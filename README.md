Gaussbock is a general-purpose tool for parameter estimation with computationaly expensive likelihood calculations, which was developed for high-dimensional cosmological parameter estimation for the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), and with upcoming surveys like the [Large Synoptic Sky Telescope (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/) and [ESA's Euclid mission](http://sci.esa.int/euclid/) in mind.
